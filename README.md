# AdvancedR3:

This project enforces good reproducible research in R practice using lipidomic data as an example.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: lipidomics.csv
-   `docs/`: learning.qmd
-   `R/`: functions.R

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`AdvancedR3.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

documentation.
