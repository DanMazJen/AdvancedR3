## Header 1

```{r setup}
source(here::here("R/functions.R"))
targets::tar_config_set(store = here::here("_targets")) # so target knows where to find objects
lipidomics <- targets::tar_read(lipidomics)

```

```{r}
# Code chunk
```

## This is poorly formatted

-   Definitely should have an empty space above this list.
-   this isn't a list, why not?
